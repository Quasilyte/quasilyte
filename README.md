I'm currently working on [NoVerify](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify) and [KPHP compiler](https://github.com/VKCOM/kphp/) at [vk.com](https://github.com/VKCOM/).

I was involved in [golang/go](https://github.com/golang/go/commits?author=quasilyte) and [golang/arch](https://github.com/golang/arch/commits?author=quasilyte) development in the past.<br>
I try to maintain several<sup>[[1]](https://go-critic.github.io/)</sup> good<sup>[[2]](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify)</sup> static<sup>[[3]](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-consistent)</sup> analyzers<sup>[[4]](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard)</sup>.<br>
Sometimes I create dev tools like [phpgrep](https://github.com/quasilyte/phpgrep) (structural PHP code search using AST patterns).

Some facts about me:
* I enjoy [3D-printing](https://www.deviantart.com/quasilyte/art/3-D-printer-gophers-802397834) and [drawing](https://quasilyte.dev/gopherkon/)
* My tech talks and articles can be found at [github.com/quasilyte/talks](https://github.com/quasilyte/talks)
